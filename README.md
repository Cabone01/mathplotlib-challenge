# Mice Studies
While working on this dataframe there are some things that I noticed in it. One that I noticed was that the rats tested on 
was nearly divided based on their sex. It is only off by a percent, but it's neat to see that they were clearly trying to see 
the effects the drug regimen had on each sex. Another was that on the box plot for Infubinol their is one somewhat far 
outlier on the Final Volume of the Tumor. Compared to the other mice within the boxplot, the outlier mice had much lower 
volume of tumors. Then there is the next thing worth noting which is my girl mouse i557. Her tumor volume was
lowering at first with the Capomulin treatment which suddenly changed at timepoint 5. Her tumor volume after that would
continue to rise with us seeing it at or nearly a tumor volume of 48 mm3. It also pretty close to passing the upper
whisker which on the boxplot is about 49. Now probably the most obivous thing to note is that there is a positive
correlation between the weight of mice and their average tumor volume. That can be clearly be seen in the plot with how both 
of them follow a very similar trend. Not only that but to reinforce it, they hade a correlation coefficent of 0.84 which is 
pretty solid.
